## 🔧 Implementation Framework

### 🎯 Priority Assessment Matrix

Evaluate each platform on:

1. **Market Pain Level (1-10):** How badly do users/workers suffer?
2. **Technical Feasibility (1-10):** Can we build it with current tech?
3. **Network Effects Barrier (1-10):** How hard to overcome chicken-egg problem?
4. **Regulatory Risk (1-10):** Will incumbents sue or lobby against us?
5. **Revenue Sustainability (1-10):** Can alternative be self-sustaining?

### 🏗️ Building Blocks Needed

**Core Infrastructure:**
- Identity layer (self-sovereign identity, decentralized auth)
- Reputation systems (portable, verifiable, not gameable)
- Payment rails (low-fee, instant, global)
- Governance frameworks (user-owned, democratic decision-making)
- Legal structures (cooperatives, DAOs, benefit corps)
- Dispute resolution (fair, transparent, community-driven)

### ⚠️ Common Failure Modes

**Pitfalls to avoid:**
- Building too complex too fast (MVP first, always)
- Ignoring network effects (need critical mass strategy)
- Underestimating incumbent response (they will fight back)
- Poor UX (open alternatives die if they're harder to use)
- Volunteer burnout (need sustainability model from day 1)
- Mission drift (staying true to principles under pressure)
